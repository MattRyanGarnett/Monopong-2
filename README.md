# Monopong-2
This is a repo for a ground-up remake of an old arcade game I made, Monopong (Original Can be found at: https://mattgarnett.itch.io/monopong)

The original code was very poorly written, and has since been lost after a reformat so I set out to rebuild it from scratch using proper coding conventions and reasonable solutions to problems.
